### About

Hey there!

I am a last-year student in the bachelor's program of Computer Science at the Amirkabir University of Technology. My interests mainly involve deep learning and complex networks, with applications in graph learning. However, I'm always open to brand-new experiences and enjoy learning new things and tackling different problems.

### Research

My chief interests include deep learning, graph learning, and computational social science. In recent years, my research has been mainly focused on deep graph generation and graph learning, which has a wide range of applications, from drug discovery to social network analysis. I've had the opportunity to work in this field under the supervision of Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee. Nevertheless, I'm hoping to expand my research in other applied machine learning domains, especially social good.
